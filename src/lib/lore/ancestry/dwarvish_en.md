# Dwarvish

The **Dwarvish** people are typically short and stocky, with lots of facial and body hair.

They can be found in large numbers in most of the major cities of the continent, especially the ones close to the mountains where they're said to be originating from. The mountains are certainly the only places where you see them making up the majority of the population of smaller towns and villages.

Common prejudices about them are that they're stubborn, drunk, greedy and obsessed with their past glory.
