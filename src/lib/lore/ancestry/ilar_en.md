# Ilar

The **Ilar** people are typically short and slender, their eyes can be any colour but they often feature epicanthic folds, their skin tone varies greatly.

They're the most widely spread of all the ancestries on the continent but nowhere are they in the majority, except for the nomad tribes of the  grassland south-eastern steppes, where they're rumoured to have originated from.

Common prejudices about them are that they're sneaky, boastful, prone to drink and obsessed with their past glory.
