# Orcish

The **Orcish** people are typically broad-shouldered and long-limbed, in some cases their body is covered in hair, skin tones may vary between darker brown hues, greyish or even a tinge of green. Their canines are often prominent.

Orcs appear to be split between cities and villages, you'll rarely find an orc in a town. Majority orc settlements are few and far between, and are mostly found where other people rarely settle: marshes, barren hills or at the edge of a desert.

Common prejudices about them are that they're brutish, primitive, overbearing and obsessed with their past glory.
