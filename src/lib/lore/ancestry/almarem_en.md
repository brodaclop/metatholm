# Almarem

The **Almarem** people are famed for their beauty. Typical Almarem features are a lack of facial and most body hair, tanned skin and in rare cases, eyes that are completely blue, including the pupil and the sclera.

These days they have settled all over the continent but many believe they originally came from the desert lands of the northwestern region.

Common prejudices about them are that they're untrustworthy, loud, quick to anger and obsessed with their past glory.
