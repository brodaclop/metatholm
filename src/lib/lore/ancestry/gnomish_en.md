# Gnomish

The **Gnomish** people are typically short and slender, they may or may not have a beard but pointy ears are quite common.

Nobody knows where gnomes came from but you can find a few in almost every city, town or village. There are even rumours of islands entirely inhabited by gnomes.

Common prejudices about them are that they're secretive, cowardly, disloyal and obsessed with their past glory.
