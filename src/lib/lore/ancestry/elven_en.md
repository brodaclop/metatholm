# Elven

The **Elven** people are typically lanky and slender, with little if any facial and body hair, pointy ears and hazel eyes.

They are said to have come from the deep forests of Metatholm but these days they can be found in most settlements with a temperate climate.

Common prejudices about them are that they're wielders of evil magics, haughty, seductive and obsessed with their past glory.
