# Flameball

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster shoots a devastating ball of flame from their finger pointing at the target. The ball starts out the size of a pebble which on reaching its destination explodes, causing `1d5!` points of fire damage for each point of strength of the spell. The damage will spread in a sphere that has a radius as many metres as the strength of the spell. (So strengthening the spell will increase both the damage and the area simultaneously.)

It's worth noting that the ball will also only travel at full power as far as the strength of the spell times 10 metres, for each 10 metres after this it weakens by 1, until at strength * 20 metres it fizzles out without an explosion.
