# Heat Material

`SpellInfo`

With this spell any non-living material can be heated up, the only limitation being that the target object can't be in contact with a living creature. (For example the clothes worn or a sword wielded by someone can't be targeted. But if the sword is leant against a wall and is only picked up after this spell has been cast on it, it will burn.)

For each strength level of this spell 1kg of material can be heated up by 100 degrees Celsius, so a small pot of water will start to boil at strength level 1. Both the amount of material and the temperature can be increased by strengthening the spell. *(If the targeted object is too big to be fully heated, it's on the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide) to decide how much it gets warmer by.)*
