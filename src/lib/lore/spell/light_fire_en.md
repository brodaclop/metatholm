# Light Fire

`SpellInfo`

With this spell the caster can conjure a small flame. It burns for 1 round and while it doesn't give off much light, it sets any flammable material it touches on fire. These fires will then happily continue to burn even after the spell ends, until someone puts them out.

Strengthening the spell can increase both the number of flames and their duration.
