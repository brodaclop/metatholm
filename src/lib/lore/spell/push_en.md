# Push

`SpellInfo`

A number of objects or living beings pointed at by the spellcaster are pushed away by an invisible force. With a spell strength of 1 the force is enough to push away a single person (or object of a similar weight) a couple of steps, increasing the strength will multiply the force, allowing the pushing away of multiple people or fewer but heavier objects.

An important effect of this spell is that if the target is in [close quarters/grappling range](rule:combat) with an opponent, this spell will automatically end it without having to resort to the [Disengage action](action:disengage).
