# Sense Poison

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster can sense any poison that can be found in a 10 metre radius. However they can only tell the total amount and the composition (e.g. "poison dart frog toxin enough to kill 3 people"), not the exact location and distribution. However touching an object or creature containing poison will reveal the exact amount and nature of poison contained in or on them.

The duration of the spell is 1 round, strengthening the spell can improve both this and the area of effect.
