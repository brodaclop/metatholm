# Lightning strike

`SpellInfo`

The caster points at a location and so long as it's outdoors, a bolt of lightning strikes it from the sky. The lightning causes `1d5!` damage.

Strengthening the spell can both increase the damage and the number of targets. (So for example at strength 4 the spell can cause `1d5!` damage to 4 targets, `2d5!` damage to 3 targets, `3d5!` to 2 targets or `4d5!` to 1 target.)
