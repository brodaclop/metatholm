# Slow Metabolism

`SpellInfo`

The living creature touched by the caster has their metabolism slowed down for the next hour. For the duration of the spell they don't need to eat or drink, and they can hold their breath for up to 10 minutes. Even poisons don't have any effect on them.

When the spell ends, everything goes back to normal, they will be just as hungry and thirsty as they would've been without the spell and poisons immediately start acting on them, unless they were neutralised or removed in the meantime.

Strengthening the spell improves the duration.
