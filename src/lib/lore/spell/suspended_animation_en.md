# Suspended Animation

`SpellInfo`

When the spellcaster touches a willing target or someone who lost their last [Life Force Point](character:ep) less than 1 round ago, they are put in suspended animation. For all intents and purposes they appear to be dead, although the [Sense Life](spell:sense_life) spell can reveal their true state on a successful [Spot Hidden](skill:spot_hidden) check against a target roll of 20.

While in this state they can't move, act or sense their surroundings but it gives one last chance for others to heal them. Note that doing so won't end this spell, the target will still be unresponsive until the spell expires. If they have more than 0 Life Force Points at that point, they "return" to life but if they aren't, they're irrevocably dead.

Strengthening the spell can increase the time period between the target losing their last LFP and the casting of the spell. (So for example at strength level 2 the target could've been "dead" for 2 rounds, 3 rounds for strength 3, etc.)
