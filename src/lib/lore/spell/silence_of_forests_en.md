# Silence of Forests

The spellcaster and the living creatures touched by them while casting this spell become an organic part of nature. Although animals will notice them, unless they act threateningly or appear to be easy prey, do not give them much heed.

In fact the natural world's noises makes the targets of this spell even less conspicuous: birds will start to sing at the exact moment a dry branch cracks under the foot of a character, crickets will chirp to the rhythm of their footsteps and the rustling of the leaves will mask the heavy breathing of an exhausted person.

If there is no animal in the vicinity to perform this service, the spell will itself conjure natural sounds appropriate to the surroundings.

In terms of gameplay this means that the targets of the spell get an extra `1d10!` when they roll a [Stalking](skill:stalking) or [Hiding](skill:hiding) skill check against someone trying to detect them by hearing alone.

At the base strength of 1 the spell can target at most 4 creatures, strengthening the spell can improve the number of targets (+1 target/1 strength level), its duration and the strength of the effect.
