# Shelter

`SpellInfo`

A 1 metre radius circle designated by the caster will become an ideal campsite for 1 day: strong winds will avoid it, rain or snow will not fall on it, ice melts, puddles and mud all dry out immediately. While the spell lasts, animals also avoid this area if they can, even biting and stinging insects.

Strengthening the spell can increase the radius of the area.
