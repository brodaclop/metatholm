# Lend Life

`SpellInfo`

This spell is the ultimate self-sacrifice, with its help the spellcaster can bestow their life force on others. The living creature touched as part of casting this spell will gain as many [Life Force Points](character:ep) as the strength level of this spell.

But the transfer isn't without loss, each LFP lent this way costs 2 for the caster.
