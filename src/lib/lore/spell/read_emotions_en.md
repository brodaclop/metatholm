# Read Emotions

`SpellInfo`

This spell allows the caster to detect the emotions of a chosen living being. The target doesn't have to be pointed at, the caster just has to look at them and will instantly know what emotions are dominating the target at the moment. The target–unless they can deduce it from the behaviour of the caster—will be unaware of what happened.

Strengthening the spell can increase the number of creatures targeted.
