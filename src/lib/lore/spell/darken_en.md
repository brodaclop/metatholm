# Darken

`SpellInfo`

This spell summons a globe of darkness with a radius of 1 metre around a point chosen by the spellcaster. Dim light can still filter in but only to a depth of 1 metre, and nothing beyond this distance is visible.

Strengthening the spell can improve the duration and the radius of the globe.
