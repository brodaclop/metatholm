# Drain Magic

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster points at a living being and can attempt to rob it of as much [Magic Power](character:mp) as is the strength of the spell.

The only catch is that this spell will cost the same amount of Magic Power to the spellcaster too. (If the caster doesn't have enough Magic Power to match the amount drained from the target, they will only lose all their remaining Magic Power, provided they had at least 1 point of it to begin with.)
