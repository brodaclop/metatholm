# Blunt Senses

`SpellInfo`

This spell will weaken the senses of any living creature chosen by the caster for 1 round.

When the target makes a [Spot Hidden](ckill:spot_hidden) check, they can only do so with 1 fewer dice, amd if they make an attack or defence roll, they can only do so with a 10 point penalty.

Strengthening the spell can improve both the effect and the duration.
