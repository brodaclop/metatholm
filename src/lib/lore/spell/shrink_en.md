# Shrink

`SpellInfo`

This spell can shrink the creature touched and everything they wear or carry by up to 50%. Their weight is reduced accordingly (by up to a factor of 8), which also means they suffer only 1/4th the damage from falling but can also only do 1/4th the damage with their weapons or bare hands.

Strengthening the spell can improve the duration.
