# Strike From Afar

`SpellInfo`

The caster points at an object than a target which makes the object (unless it's secured or restrained somehow) hurtle at the target at great speed. The target, if capable of it can make a [Reactions](skill:reactions) skill check against the spellcaster's [Spacetime Focus](skill:spacetime_focus) skill, and if unsuccessful, the object will hit the target doing as many `1d5!` points of damage as the strength of the spell.

This applies to a solid and hard object weighing about 5 kg. If the object is not as solid or hard, the damage will be less but if it's spiky or sharp, it will be more.

If the object is lighter, the damage will also be less however the spellcaster will get a bonus on their skill check to hit the target as the object will fly faster. The reverse is true if the object is heavier. *The deviation will need to be determined by the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide) but a rule of thumb is that +-`1d5!` damage can be traded for -+ 1 die on the evasion skill check.*

Objects heavier than 20 kg can't be moved this way, nor can any living creatures.
