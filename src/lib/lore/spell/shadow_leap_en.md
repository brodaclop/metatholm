# Shadow Leap

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster can "leap" into a nearby shadow. In reality this means entering the realm of shadows and quickly exiting it at the chosen location. The range of this spell is 10 metres.

Strenthening the spell can increase the range or allow the caster to take others along for the journey (1 strength level per additional person), provided they are touching either the spellcaster or someone who is.
