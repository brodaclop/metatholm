# Cloak of Shadow

`SpellInfo`

The creature touched by the caster gets surrounded by animated shadows, resulting in an extra dice on their skill check for [Hiding](skill:hiding) or [Stalking](skill:stalking) so long as the target tries to hide/stalk in the dark.

Strengthening the spell can improve both the effect and the duration.
