# Spirit Shroud

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster summons protective spirits around the living creature touched. The spirits will stay around the target for 1 day and during that time will protect them against any mind-affecting spell or other magical effect. The only exception is the [Message](spell:message) spell, which they (reluctantly) agree to leave untouched. Every other effect however they will "feed" on, reducing the strength of it by as much as the strength of this spell. Naturally if this reduces a spell's strenght to zero, the effect won't reach the target at all.
