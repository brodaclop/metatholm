# Write Memories

`SpellInfo`

This spell can modify the memories of the targeted living creature, although only memories of the moments immediately preceding the casting of this spell. For every strength level of the spell, 1 round's worth of memories can be erased from the mind of a creature the caster can see, or replaced with fake memories for double the strength.

It's worth noting that while the target will not directly notice they are under the effect of this spell, depending on the situation the missing memories or implausible fake memories can quickly make them suspicious.
