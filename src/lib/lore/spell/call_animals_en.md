# Call Animals

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster calls forth the animals in the surrounding areas. The call will only be "heard" by the targeted animals, they will immediately make their way towards the caster and will try to get there to the best of their abilities. Targets can be selected by the spellcaster pointing at them (if they can be seen) or can choose to think of a kind of animal and try to address all of them who may be around. In either case the spell will affect at most as many animals as the spell's strength.

Once they answered the call, the animals will behave according to their normal temperament, so if they were afraid of the caster before, they'll continue to be afraid and will try to flee, if they see the caster as prey, they'll attack, etc.
