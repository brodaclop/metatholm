# Fool Senses

`SpellInfo`

The spellcaster can summon spirits and convinces them to take on a visible and tangible shape of the caster's choice, thus creating an illusion. If the illusion is strong enough, it will appear real for everyone perceiving it, even if they know it's an illusion. The caster themselves may barely be able to see through the illusion, seeing all the things that may be obscured by them. The visual element of the illusion must fit into a sphere of 1 metre radius, its scent can travel up to 5 metres and its sound to 10 metres. This can be improved by strengthening the spell.

The believability of the illusion is primarily determined by how complex and how out of place the conjured effect it. With a spell strength of 1 only inanimate things that blend into their surroundings are possible (e.g. a closed door in an otherwise empty door frame), for animals a minimum strength of 2 is needed, while a walking and talking human's illusion has to have at least a strenth of 5 to fool anyone casting more than a cursory glance at it.

Finally, strenghthening the spell can also improve its duration.
