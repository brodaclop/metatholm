# Steal Time

`SpellInfo`

The target of this spell loses 5 action points in the next round. (So instead of `1d10!+10` they can only roll `1d10!+5`.) If the target is already under the influence of this spell, the old spell immediately ceases to exist.

Strengthening the spell can improve both the effect and the duration.
