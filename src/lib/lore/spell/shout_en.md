`SpellInfo`

This spell grants an extra `1d10!` to the caster's next skill check, provided that the check happens immediately after the casting of the spell. It therefore can't be used to boost an activity that lasts a considerable amount of time, for example forging a blade or picking a lock. It can however be used in combat, in which case it will give +10 to attack/defence rolls.

Strenthening the spell can improve the effect.
