# Farsight

`SpellInfo`

The target of this spell can see things at a 1 km distance as if they were only a few steps away. Of course lighting and visibility conditions don't change, if they can't see in the dark or through thick fog, this spell won't change that.

Strengthening the spell can improve both the duration and the distance.
