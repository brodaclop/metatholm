# Extinguish Fire

`SpellInfo`

This spell will extinguish fires that are already burning, be they of magical or natural origin. To extinguish magical fire (e.g. [Wall of Flame](spell:tapestry_of_flame) spell), the strength of this spell has to equal or exceed the strength of the targeted magical effect.

For the strength required for natural fires see the table below:

| Size of fire | Strength required |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Candle/lantern/torch | 1 |
| Campfire | 2 |
| Small bonfire | 3 |
| Fire beacon | 4 |
| Blacksmith's forge/burning house | 5 |

The strength can of course be split between multiple targets, making it possible to extinguish several smaller fires at once.

Once the spellcaster points at the target(s), the flames die down almost instantly and if there's anything feeding the fire, it will also cool down enough so that the fire won't be reignited by a strong breeze.
