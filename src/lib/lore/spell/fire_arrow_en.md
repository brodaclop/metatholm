# Fire Arrow

`SpellInfo`

This spell is the simplest example of offensive elemental magic: out of the spellcaster's fingertips springs forward a bolt of flame and hurtles towards the target. If the target is a living and moving creature who isn't surprised by the attack, they can attempt to evade it. For this they need to do a [Reactions](skill:reactions) skill check contested by the spellcaster's [Elemental Focus](skill:elemental_focus) skill. If the spellcaster wins the contest, the target will suffer as many `1d5!` dice of fire damage as the spell's strength.

At higher strengths the spellcaster can choose to split it into multiple (weaker) arrows, targeting multiple targets, who can each attempt to evade it separately.
