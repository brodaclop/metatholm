# Insignificance

`SpellInfo`

This spell calls upon the spirits of a place to make the living creature touched by the caster appear insignificant to others. The effect doesn't hide the target or make them invisible, everyone can still plainly see and hear the target but deem them unworthy of attention. If observers concentrate on perceiving the target, they can roll a contested [Spot Hidden](skill:spot_hidden) check against `1d10!`, but they need to repeat this roll every round or their attention slips.

The spell doesn't however work on observers who are aware of the target when the spell is cast. (Which is a good thing, otherwise a team of vagabonds made insignificant this way would very quickly lose track of each other.) The spell is also rendered ineffective if the target does something that obviously draws attention to them, like start shouting or attack someone.

Strengthening the spell can improve the strength of the effect, the duration of the spell or the number of creatures targeted.
