# Convert Life to Magic

`SpellInfo`

This spell allows the caster to sacrifice their own [Life Force](character:ep) for [Magic Power](character:mp). This is only possible if this spell can be cast without Life Force cost (see under [Magic](rule:magic)), on successful casting each sacrificed Life Force Point will recover as many Magic Power as is the strength of the spell.
