# Heal

`SpellInfo`

This spell will heal the wounds and broken bones of the creature touched by the spellcaster, restoring their life force.

On a successful casting the spellcaster can decide how many [Magic Power](character:mp) points (on top of the regular cost of the spell) they intend to use for healing. For each MP the target heals as many [Life Force Points](character:ep) as the strength of this spell.
