# Extinguish Magic

`SpellInfo`

This spell is very simple: the caster only has to point at the target of an active spell or magical effect and so long as the strength of this spell exceeds the one to be extinguished, it ceases immediately.

Of course effects of the spell that have already happened can't be reversed this way, the damage done by a fire spell will remain even if the fire dies down. It's also worth noting that this spell can only extinguish spells with a duration, those that take effect instantaneously (e.g. [Lend Life](spell:lend_life) spell) can't be extinguished.

The spellcaster doesn't have to know the targeted spell, in fact they don't even need to be aware of it, it's enough if they suspect it's there. If the targeted spell affects multiple targets, the caster can point to any of them. *(If the targeted creature/object is under the effect of more than one spell or if the "suspicion" sounds far-fetched, the dungeon master should ask the player what kind of magical effect they want to remove, for example "I want my friend to regain their vision" or "I believe this innkeeper is an assassin who disguises himself with magic").
