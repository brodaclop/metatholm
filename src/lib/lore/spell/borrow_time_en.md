# Borrow Time

`SpellInfo`

The target of this spell receives +5 action points in the next round. (So instead of `1d10!+10` they can roll `1d10!+15`.) If the target is already under the influence of this spell, the old spell immediately ceases to exist.

Strengthening the spell can improve both the effect and the duration.
