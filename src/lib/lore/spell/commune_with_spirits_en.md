# Commune With Spirits

`SpellInfo`

This spell allows the caster to ask for the spirits roaming free in the world for help. The spirits heeding the call will improve the caster's knowledge and mental power, meaning that their next skill check for a **Knowledge** type skill will be done with 1 extra die.

It's important to note that the caster can only ask for help with one thing at a time, and while the spirits are helpful, they aren't too patient. If the caster starts doing something unrelated to the skill check in question, the spirits will just wander off.

Strengthening the spell can improve the effect.
