# Telekinesis

`SpellInfo`

The caster distorts space with their will around the targeted object or living creature, which allows the caster to move the target (unless it's somehow anchored to its place) in any direction. The effect however is slow, at a rate of only 10 metres per round horizontally, and 3 metres vertically. The "carrying capacity" of this spell is 100 kgs, which can be improved by strengthening the spell.

The effect lasts for 1 round, which can also be improved at higher strengths.
