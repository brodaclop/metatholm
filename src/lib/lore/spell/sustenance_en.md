`SpellInfo`

When this spell is cast with strength 1, it "provides" one day's worth of the water intake of the caster. At a strength of 2 it replaces eating as well, 3 a good night's sleep on top of the first two effects (this doesn't affect healing but for example it can allow a character to march without stopping). If the target is relying on this spell for the following day, the strength requirements double, on the third consecutive day they treble and so on until they spend a whole day eating, drinking and sleeping normally.
