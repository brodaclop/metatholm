# Whispering Shadows

`SpellInfo`

The caster can send a short message to whoever they concentrate on. The target must be seen or known sufficiently well by the caster.

The message will literally be whispered into the ears of the target in a voice recognisable (by those who are familiar with it) as that of the spellcaster. In fact if someone is standing very close to the target, they may even overhear a few stray words.

The maximum range of this spell is 1km, which grows to 5km between blood relatives and 10km between twins.

The duration of the spell is 1 round that can be improved with strengthening the spell, as can the number of targets.
