# Cast (Slow)

`ActionInfo`

This action is used whenever a spell is to be cast at slow speed. Casting a spell slow adds 1 to the effective skill level of the caster, allowing for easier spell rolls.

## Action Points

Slow casting a spell always takes the entire combat round and can thus only be attempted as the first action of the caster in that round. The caster can't perform any other action during this round, including defending incoming attacks.
