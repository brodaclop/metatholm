`ActionInfo`

This is a reaction to be used to defend against ranged attacks, including thrown weapons. The constant and unpredictable changes in direction make aiming considerably harder both for the attacker and the defender (should they wish to shoot back), and under normal circumstances it's impossible to run at speed this way, with walking speed being the maximum achievable.

## Defensive roll

The defensive roll is always `d100+100`.
