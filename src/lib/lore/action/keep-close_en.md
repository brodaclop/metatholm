# Keep Close

`ActionInfo`

If a character is in close quarters, they can stop their opponent trying to move away with this action.

## Roll

Defence rolls are made with `d100`, plus the defence modifier, which is in turn calculated from the **defence** property of the weapon, the difficulty of the combat skill used and the skill level of the user. The weapon's reach is then added to this because when in measure, a longer reach is an advantage.
