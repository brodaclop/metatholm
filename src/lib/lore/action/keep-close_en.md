# Keep Close

`ActionInfo`

If a character is in close quarters, they can stop their opponent trying to move away with this action.

## Roll

Keep close rolls are made with `d100`, plus the defence modifier, which is in turn calculated from the type and **defence** property of the weapon and the skill rank of the user. Five times the weapon's **reach** is then subtracted from this because in close quarters combat a longer reach is a disadvantage.
