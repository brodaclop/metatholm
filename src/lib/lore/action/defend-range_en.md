# Defend (Ranged)

`ActionInfo`

This is the reaction to be used to defend against ranged attacks, including thrown weapons.

## Roll

Defence rolls are made with `d100`, plus the defence modifier, which is in turn calculated from the **defence** property of the weapon, the difficulty of the combat skill used and the skill level of the user.
