# Step Out

`ActionInfo`

If a character is in measure (i.e. they are in melee range but not in close quarters), using this action allows them to step out, ending melee combat. This action takes no time and can't be countered.

> [note]: #
Of course unless the character does something to put distance between them and their opponent, nothing in this action prevents the opponent from stepping in again and continuing the fight as soon as it's their turn.
