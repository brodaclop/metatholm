# Knockout

`ActionInfo`

This is the action to be used when attempting to trip or topple somebody over in combat.

## Action Points

How many action points this action costs depends on two factors: the **speed** of the weapon and the skill rank of the user.

## Roll

The attacking character has to roll a [Trick Fighting](skill:trick_fighting) check [contested](rule:skill_check) by the target's [Balance](skill:balance) skill. 

## On Success

On success the opponent falls over and is thus unable to use their [Keep Away](action:keep-away) action to stop opponents closing in on them.
