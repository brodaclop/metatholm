# Move predictably

`ActionInfo`

This is a reaction to be used to defend against ranged attacks, including thrown weapons. Predictable movement includes walking and running in a straight line, which makes aiming somewhat harder both for the attacker and the defender (should they wish to shoot back).

## Defensive roll

The defensive roll is always `d100+50`.
