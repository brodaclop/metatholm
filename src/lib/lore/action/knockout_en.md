# Knockout

`ActionInfo`

This is the action to be used when attempting to knock out an opponent outright. It's usually best attempted against a defenceless opponent.

## Action Points

How many action points this action costs depends on two factors: the **speed** of the weapon and the skill level of the user.

## Roll

The attacking character has to roll a [Trick Fighting](skill:trick_fighting) check [contested](rule:skill_check) by the target's [Endurance](skill:endurance) skill.

## On Success

On success the opponent loses consciousness for a few minutes, and is thus at the mercy of those around them.
