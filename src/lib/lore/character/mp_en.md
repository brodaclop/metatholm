# Magic Power

A character's **Magic Power** points represent how much magical energy expendable on [casting spells](rule:magic) they have in reserve. This value could at most be as much as their [Magic Force](skill:magic_force) skill. Regaining spent magic power is possible via rest or sleep, one quiet night or day is enough to recover them all.
