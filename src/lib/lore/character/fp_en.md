# Pain tolerance

**Pain tolerance** points **(PTP)** are a measure of how much pain a character can take. The maximum pain tolerance of a character depends on their level, their [Pain Threshold](skill:pain_threshold) skill and their [Endurance](skill:endurance) skill. On top of this, on every level except the first, the result of a `2d10` roll is added. (On the first level the character is automatically awarded 20 points instead.)

Whenever a character sustains damage, it is subtracted from their pain tolerance, and if it reaches 0, the character passes out from the pain, strain, bleeding or exhaustion.

*Note: although for the sake of simplicity this number is called pain tolerance, in reality lost pain tolerance also represents bruises, scrapes, small nicks and cuts, burns, twisted joints, etc.*

If a single attack delivers more than 10 points of damage, on top of the pain tolerance loss, one [life force](character:ep) point is also lost per 10 points of damage. So if the attack does 27 points of damage, the character will lose 27 pain tolerance points and 2 [life force](character:ep) points. But if 3 separate attacks deliver 9 points of damage each, the character will only lose the same 27 pain tolerance points.

Unlike [life force](character:ep), pain tolerance is relatively easy to recover, although thorough resting and being tended by a [medic](skill:medicine) helps.
