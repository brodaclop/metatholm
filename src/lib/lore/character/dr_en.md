# Damage Reduction

When a character fails to defend effectively and suffers an injury, their armour can still protect them from its worst effects. This is because the **Damage Reduction** of the armour can be deducted from both the [PTP](character:fp) and the [LFP](character:ep) damage suffered, with some luck even reducing them to zero.

For example if someone is cut with a sword and the damage would be **21 PTPs**, this would also mean **2 LFPs** of serious damage. However if their armour has a **damage reduction** of **1**, the actual damage will only be 21 - 1 = **20 PTPs** and 2 - 1 = **1 LFP**. If their armour was even better quality and offered a **damage reduction** of **2**, the damage would be further reduced to 21 - 2 = **19 PTPs** and 2 - 2 = **0 LFP**, practically a flesh wound.

As can be seen from this example, damage reduction is most useful in avoiding serious injuries and thus death, but painful bruises, scrapes and bleeding surface wounds can with time still force the fighters into submission.
