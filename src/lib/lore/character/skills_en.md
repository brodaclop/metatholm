# Skills

## What is a skill?

Skills represent a character's [learned](rule:learning_skills) knowledge. Unlike [abilities](rule:abilities), which stay largely fixed throughout your lifetime, skills can be learnt/trained for. The level of training a character has is called their **skill level**. 

| Skill level | Description | Notes |
| :------------|:-|:-|
| 0 | Unskilled/Untrained | You can attempt only the simplest of tasks, and even then failure is more likely than success. |
| 1-2 | Beginner/Apprentice | You are familiar with the basics of the field, albeit probably more instinctively than consciously. |
| 3-4 | Skilled/Journeyman | You can make a living out of using your skill, if it's the kind of thing people pay for. You can converse about your field and are a reliable judge of others' skill level. |
| 5-6 | Expert/Master | You are an accepted expert of your field. You are now also capable of training others in this skill. |
| 7-8 | Grandmaster | You are a known authority, masters of the field will recognise your work and defer to you. |
| 9-10 | Living legend | Your name is known by all serious practitioners of this skill, and will be remembered for centuries. |

## Skill checks

In most cases, using a skill requires a skill check. Skill checks are rolled with [exploding dice](rule:exploding_dice), for which you will use as many d10s as your skill level. If you're unskilled, you can roll a single d5 instead.

Your skill check is considered successful if your dice total reaches or exceeds the target number, which depends on the difficulty of the task. Typical target numbers for the various difficulties are as follows:

| Difficulty | Typical target |
| :- | :- |
| Easy | 5 |
| Average | 10 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Legendary | 40 |
| Impossible | 80 |

It's worth noting that the difficulty of a task is not solely determined by the nature of the task itself, circumstances can play a decisive part. Sure, any sailor can tie a reef knot. It's an easy task. But doing so with one hand, in the middle of a raging storm? Suddenly that "easy" task has become a lot harder.

The table below shows how likely you are to succeed a skill check, given your skill level and the task's difficulty.
