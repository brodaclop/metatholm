# Skills

## What is a skill?

Skills represent a character's [learned](rule:learning_skills) knowledge. Unlike [abilities](character:abilities), which stay largely fixed throughout your lifetime, skills can be learnt/trained for. The level of training a character has is called their **skill level**. 

| Skill level | Description | Notes |
| :------------|:-|:-|
| 0 | Unskilled/Untrained | You can attempt only the simplest of tasks, and even then failure is more likely than success. |
| 1-2 | Beginner/Apprentice | You are familiar with the basics of the field, albeit probably more instinctively than consciously. |
| 3-4 | Skilled/Journeyman | You can make a living out of using your skill, if it's the kind of thing people pay for. You can converse about your field and are a reliable judge of others' skill level. |
| 5-6 | Expert/Master | You are an accepted expert of your field. You are now also capable of training others in this skill. |
| 7-8 | Grandmaster | You are a known authority, masters of the field will recognise your work and defer to you. |
| 9-10 | Living legend | Your name is known by all serious practitioners of this skill, and will be remembered for centuries. |

## What kind of skills exist?

Skills are split into one of the following categories: **Basic**, **Movement**, **Combat**, **Focus** and **Knowledge**.


`SkillListByType|{"type": "skill_type:basic", "caption": "**Basic skills** are fundamental traits that can't really be taught or learnt. They can only really be trained by practising."}`

`SkillListByType|{"type": "skill_type:movement", "caption": "**Movement skills** are very similar to basic skills, except they relate to various forms of movement. The main difference in practice is that the use of these skills can be hindered by wearing armour."}`

`SkillListByType|{"type": "skill_type:combat", "caption": "**Combat skills** are used in, you guessed it, combat. Each combat skill represents either a style of fighting or knowledge of a weapon family."}`

`SkillListByType|{"type": "skill_type:focus", "caption": "**Focus skills** are the ones used to cast magic spells. Higher skills not only make a character's existing spells more reliable but also give them access to more powerful spells."}`

`SkillListByType|{"type": "skill_type:knowledge", "caption": "**Knowledge** skills rely mainly on lexical knowledge. They usually require a teacher or a book to study, although some can be improved via experimentation too."}`

## How to use skills?

Use of **Combat** skills is mainly governed by specific [rules of combat](rule:combat) although in certain situations they may also be used like **Knowledge** skills, for example when observing a fight and judging a participant's skill, or determining the value or origin of a weapon.

Similarly, **Focus** skills' main purpose is to cast magic spells, according to the rules of magic, but they also reflect a character's general knowledge about a particular area of magic.

When using any other skill, the main way of utilising them is via [skill checks](rule:skill_check).
