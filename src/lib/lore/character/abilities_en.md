# Abilities

A character's **abilities** are a character's fundamental, long-lasting traits. Each is determined as a number between 0 and 10 at character creation and will stay largely unchanged throughout the character's life.

Each character has four abilities:

* [Build](ability:build)
* [Activity](ability:activity)
* [Presence](ability:presence)
* [Magic](ability:magic)

As abilities are all rather abstract, they don't directly influence the outcome of dice rolls in the game.  Their effect instead is to influence how hard it is for the character to learn various [skills](character:skills). For example a naturally heavy-set person will learn to lift weights or fight with maces faster, as they can practise longer without having to stop for a break, while a lightly built character will have an easier time learning to climb walls or to train their endurance.
