# Patron

Gods have no power in Metatholm. They can interfere in its matters neither directly nor indirectly.

This is exactly what attracts them to it.

For what better place to look for a [spirit](world:concepts:spirits) that may one day be worthy to represent them as a prophet or even avatar in some other world. If they can stay true to a deity's ideals without any divine help, maybe they will also succeed in resisting the corrupting force of being the living embodiment of one.

In game terms this means that during creation each player has to choose a divine being as their character's "patron". This could be a being from any other fantasy world or ancient myth, or even completely made up on the spot. Every time the character acts in a way the **Game Master** deems to have represented the chosen deity's ideals well, they have a chance of being awarded an [Ideal Point](character:ip).

As the character accumulates these points, their spirit will shine brighter in the spirit world, attracting follower spirits who may be willing to help the character in mystical ways.
