# Patron

Gods have no power in Metatholm. They can interfere in its matters neither directly nor indirectly.

This is exactly what attracts them to it.

For what better place to look for a [spirit](world:concepts:spirits) that may one day be worthy to represent them as a prophet or even avatar in some other world. If they can stay true to a deity's ideals without any divine help, maybe they will also succeed in resisting the corrupting force of being the living embodiment of one.

In game terms this means that each player character has to choose a divine being as their "patron" (although no actual patronage is happening during the game). This could be a being from any other fantasy world or ancient myth, or even completely made up on the spot. Every time the character acts in a way the **Game Master** deems to have represented the chosen deity's ideals well, they have a chance of being awarded an [Ideal Point](character:ip).

As the character accumulates these points, their spirit will shine brighter in the spirit world, attracting followers who may be willing to help the character later on. These follower spirits can inhabit the character's weapons, armour, other treasured possessions, as well as their companion animals (should they have any), enhancing their abilities in a myriad ways.
