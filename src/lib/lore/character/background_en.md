# Background

A character's **background** shows what kind of prior experience they had when they started adventuring. This is of course chosen by the player at character creation, and while the decision influences the [abilities](character:abilities) and starting [skills](character:skills) of the character, it has no further effect on the further development opportunities on the character.

Of course the above is only true in game terms, a reputation gained in the early days is probably quite hard to shake.
