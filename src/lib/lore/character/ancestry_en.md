# Ancestral spirit

The people of Metatholm are many, but at the end of the day they're all just people. However it was not always this way. A long time ago powerful spirits emerged (or arrived, who knows) in this world, taking the form of entire nations, each looking and behaving very differently to each other. They spread across the world, formed alliances, warred and as it was always bound to happen, occasionally fallen in love. All this led to the differences diminishing over time, and as they did, so waned the power of the once powerful spirits they embodied.

But they never quite went away, every inhabitant of Metatholm still carries a spark of one of these **ancestral spirits** that have the power to shape their physical, mental and magical traits, even if far less so than they used to.

For the purposes of game mechanics, this means that each character needs to choose an **ancestral spirit**.

This will affect their [abilities](character:abilities) and to a certain extent, their looks. Characters with a gnomish ancestry tend to be short and slight, dwarven ancestry often manifests in stockiness and ample facial hair, and so on. But while appearance will always hint at ancestry, it manifests itself in different ways in different individuals. This is especially true for the children of parents with different ancestries. While their looks are likely to be dominated by a mixture of both their lineages, in game terms they will only inherit one ancestry (chosen at random, should such a choice ever need to be made).

Of course the world of Metatholm isn't devoid of prejudice, so some of its inhabitants will be convinced that certain ancestries imply certain personality traits. This is not true in this game but sadly it won't stop them from insisting. Even worse, they will also confidently claim they can always tell your "true" ancestry.

The ancestral spirits available for player characters are:
