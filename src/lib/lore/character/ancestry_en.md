# Ancestry

The people of Metatholm are many, but at the end of the day they're all just people. Nevertheless, for the purposes of game mechanics, each character needs to choose an **ancestry**.

This will affect their [abilities](character:abilities) and to a certain extent, their physical features. Characters with a gnomish ancestry tend to be short and slight, dwarven ancestry often manifests in stockiness and ample facial hair, and so on. But while appearance will always hint at ancestry, it manifests itself in different ways in different individuals. This is especially true for the children of parents with different ancestries. While their looks are likely to be dominated by a mixture of both their lineages, in game terms they will only inherit one ancestry (chosen at random, should such a choice ever need to be made).

Of course the world of Metatholm isn't devoid of prejudice, so some of its inhabitants will be convinced that certain ancestries imply certain personality traits. This is not true in this game but sadly it won't stop them from insisting. Even worse, they will also confidently claim they can always tell your "true" ancestry.

The ancestries available for player characters are:
