# Ideal Points

Ideal points represent how well a character has aligned themselves with the ideals of their [patron deity](character:patron). They can be earned when a character performs an act that is dear to the deity. When the character reaches an **Ideal Point** total that is a multiple of 5, they gain a new [spirit animal](character:spirit_animals).

They can (rarely) also be lost if the character does something that is the complete anthithesis of what the deity stands for. This doesn't affect spirit animals already acquired, it just makes it harder to attract the next follower.

**Note to Spirit Guides:** Although it'd be difficult to give detailed guidelines on which precise situations merit the gifting of an Ideal Point, it's certainly better to be too generous with them than too tight-fisted. As spirit animals are what lends real colour and individuality to a character, if a player can't acquire one even after 10-20 game sessions, that'd lead to quite a boring game. How generous is too generous? Let's say if a character has twice as many spirit animals as character levels, that's probably too much.
