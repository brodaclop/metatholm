# Ideal Points

Ideal points represent how well a character has aligned themselves with the ideals of their [patron deity](character:patron). They can be earned when a character performs an act that is dear to the deity and can (rarely) be lost if they do something that is the complete anthithesis of what the deity stands for.

When the character reaches an **Ideal Point** total that is a multiple of 5, they gain a new [spirit animal](character:spirit_animals).
