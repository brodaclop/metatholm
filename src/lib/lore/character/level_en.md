# Level

A character's level is an approximation of their experience and power. Every player character starts as level 1 and they will gain an extra level at the end of each episode of their adventures. *(Note: what constitutes "an episode" is of course up to the Game Master, the exact definition will depend on the type of game the group would want to play. In any case the end of an episode should be an event that brings some kind of temporary conclusion to the narrative and an opportunity for the characters to rest, recover and regroup.)*

When gaining a new level, a character will also gain extra [Pain Tolerance points](character:fp), an extra [Life Force point](character:ep) and [Skill Points](character:kp) that can be spent on [learning skills](rule:learning_skills).
