# Spirit Animals

Spirit animals are the [spirits](world:concepts:spirits) following a character if they are deemed [worthy](character:patron) of being followed. While they are called spirit animals, they're not exactly animals, they just remind people of certain animals.

When your character gains an [Ideal Point](character:ip) and their total reaches a multiple of 5, you gain a spirit animal. The GM will pick the animal (either based on you or your patron's personality, what fits with the story or just randomly) but you can choose its **manifestation** from the list available for that animal, with each manifestation bestowing your character with a different mystical power.

You can change the manifestation later whenever you gain a [level](character:level). You can have multiple followers of the same animal type, in this case you can choose a different manifestation for each of them.
