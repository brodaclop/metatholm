# Life Force

**Life Force** points **(LFP)** are a measure of how many serious wounds a character can take. The maximum life force of a character is 9+[level](character:level) and after every 10 points of [pain tolerance](character:fp) lost in a single attack the character loses 1 life force point. If they reach 0, the character dies.

Recovering life force is hard, a character needs to spend a whole day resting and recuperating just to regain a single point. This process can be sped up if attended to by someone with the [Medicine](skill:medicine) skill, or via various healing potions and spells. *Obviously no-one can heal beyond their maximum life force points.*
