# Skill check

Skill checks are rolled with [exploding dice](rule:exploding_dice), for which you will use as many `d10!`s as your skill level. If you're unskilled, you can roll a single `d5!` instead.

## Contested

A skill check is considered contested when two or more participants pit their skills against each other. This could be the same skill (for example opposing [Strength](skill:strength) checks during arm wrestling) or different skills (for example one character using [Camouflage](skill:camouflage) to hude from someone, who will have to roll [Spot Hidden](skill:spot_hidden) to spot them). In either case the results of the roll are compared and whoever's is the highest wins the contest. If it's a tie, then everything stays the same, as if the contest didn't happen (so in the arm wrestling neither party wins, in the hiding scenario the character remains hidden).

## Uncontested

In an uncontested skill check the character is up against a challenge with fixed difficulty. This difficulty is determined by the GM and is expressed as a **target number**. Your skill check is considered successful if your dice total reaches or exceeds the target number, which depends on the difficulty of the task. Typical target numbers for the various difficulties are as follows:

| Difficulty | Typical target |
| :- | :- |
| Easy | 5 |
| Average | 10 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Legendary | 40 |
| Impossible | 80 |

It's worth noting that the difficulty of a task is not solely determined by the nature of the task itself, circumstances can play a decisive part. Sure, any sailor can tie a reef knot. It's an easy task. But doing so with one hand, in the middle of a raging storm? Suddenly that "easy" task has become a lot harder.

The table below shows how likely you are to succeed a skill check, given your skill level and the task's difficulty.
