# Exploding dice

When rolling **exploding dice** we roll the dice like normal and add up the numbers but whenever a die rolls a maximum, it is rerolled and the new value is added to the total too. 

If the reroll is a maximum too, we repeat the process, and so on. The symbol for exploding dice used in this game is **!**, so `3d10!` means roll a 10 sided die 3 times, and reroll the ones that roll a 10.
