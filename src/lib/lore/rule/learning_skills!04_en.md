# Learning skills

Learning a skill requires the dedication of time and effort. In the game the amount of it available for a character is expressed as **skill points**. Skill points are gained when the character gains a new level and can be spent to learn a new skill or improve a known skill.

How many points are required to train a skill to the next rank depends on the following factors:

1. **The current skill rank.** The more you know, the harder it is to improve on it.
2. **The skill's difficulty.** Some skills are simply harder to learn than others.
3. **The character's abilities.** Most skills are easier to learn if one of your abilities is particularly high or low. Training with heavy weapons for example comes much more easily to someone who is naturally heavy set than to someone with a slight physique.
