# Build

A character with a high **Build** ability isn't necessarily muscular but they're heavy-set: their chest and shoulders are wide and their limbs are thick relative to their height. You'd probably call them stocky when short and towering if tall. Either way, a high **Build** makes it easier to build up fast-twitch muscles, making the character capable of amazing feats of strength.

A character with low **Build** can be tall and gangly, or short and wiry, both will give them a good opportunity to develop the slow muscles necessary for rock climbers or elite endurance athletes.
