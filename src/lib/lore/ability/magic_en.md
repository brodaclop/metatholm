# Magic

Magic is in everyone, but not in equal measure.

A character with a high **Magic** ability is easy for magic to pass through. Controlling it is easy for them to learn, magic is almost drawn to them.

A character with low **Magic** on the other hand will usually struggle creating magical effects. But precisely because magic finds it difficult to affect them, they can develop superior resistance to harmful magic.
