# Activity

A character with a high **Activity** ability never seems to stop moving. They can be quick, they can be twitchy, a coiled spring or a bundle of energy. You don't want to mess with a skilled knife fighter with high **Activity**.

A character with low **Activity** may appear sluggish but maybe they're just being very careful and precise. They possess the kind of deliberate and controlled movement and even keel that will serve them well while mixing acids, dressing wounds or aim a bow.
