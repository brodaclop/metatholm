# Presence

A character with a high **Presence** ability is always in the centre of attention. They can be brash and loud, they can make you want to follow them into battle, or they can be quiet, radiating charm without words. You can love them or hate them, the one thing you can't do is ignore them.

A character with low **Presence** is easy to miss and hard to remember. They rarely draw attention to themselves and never look out of place. Few will notice an assassin with low **Presence** arriving, and even fewer notice them leaving.
