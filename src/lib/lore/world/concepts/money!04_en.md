# Money

The many realms of Metatholm can have very different economies, currencies and approach to money itself. But some things are true of them all in general, for example that money doesn't play as central a role in everyday life as it does in our world. That isn't to say having money isn't important or critical even, just that **having money is often not enough**. There are many things that aren't for sale or aren't for sale to anyone.

And even the things that are for sale rarely have a fixed price written on a neat tag, the cost of food in a city can change drastically with the seasons for example (which is why sometimes basic food items eaten by poor people **do** have their prices set in law).

All this means that instead of tracking their coins precisely, player characters have a [wealth](character:wealth) attribute, which gives a rough idea of their spending power when it comes to obtaining goods with money only.

> Firstly, it eliminates a lot of quite boring admin around money, both on the players' behalf and yours. The moments of recording money and payment often break up the flow of the game and add very little to the experience in return.

> Secondly, it makes it much easier for you to construct individual "price tables" for each scene in your adventure, lending your locations more colour and variety.
