# Spirit Guide

Some games call them Game Master, Dungeon Master or Adventure Facilitator, we call them **Spirit Guides**.

The role of the **Spirit Guide** is to bring the world of Metatholm to life and provide the [players](world:concepts:character) with an adventure.

As the name suggests, the **Spirit Guide** is not a "master" of any kind, their role is to guide everyone through the game. This can be quite a complex task, including aspects such as:

* As the rules of the game are intentionally quite generic, it's you who has to figure out what rules to apply in a given situatoin and how. For example what skills a player has to roll a check for and against what target number, if indeed they need to roll at all.
* Reward players behaving a way befitting their [patron](character:patron) with [Ideal Points](character:ip) and choose them a suitable [spirit animal](character:spirit_animals).
* During combat decide what situational modifiers apply to a given action.
* Fill in the gaps and uncertainties in Metatholm's lore, decide which version of reality is the truth and what are unfounded beliefs.
