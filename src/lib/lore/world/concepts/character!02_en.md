# The Player Character

In this game player characters are all "vagabonds". The vagabond falls outside normal society in most countries, without rights but without obligations too. In a way player characters were born for adventuring. Although their physical and mental abilities ostensibly don't surpass other people's, their life force and their sheer will to live makes them stand out.

## Patron

Whether this is the reason or the result of being shunned by society, your character represents an otherworldy [patron](character:patron) who must be chosen when the character is created. You can then attempt to play your character according to the values of your chosen patron, and doing so will be rewarded by the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide) by granting you [spirit animal](character:spirit_animals) followers.

## Abilities

Every player character has 4 [(base) abilities](character:abilities). These are innate and almost never change throughout the chracter's life. Their value is between 0 and 10.

Unlike in many other similar games, the role of these abilities is fairly limited: their sole purpose is to indicate how easily or otherwise the character can learn certain skills. A further difference is that in certain cases lower ability scores are more advantageous than higher ones. Which skill relies on which ability and whether it has a positive or negative effect can be found out from the description of the individual abilities ([Build](ability:build), [Activity](ability:activity), [Presence](ability:presence), [Magic](ability:magic))

## Skills

Every time a player tries to perform an action that is important from the game's perspective and its outcome is uncertain, they need to rely on their skills. Their skill rank can also be between 0 and 10.

Skills can be used in multiple ways: in some cases a [skill check](rule:skill_check) is needed, other situations like [combat](rule:combat) or [magic](rule:magic) have their own dedicated rules.

Characters can of course possess other knowledge not covered by skills (e.g. various trades), these can simply be noted in the **Notes** section of the character sheet after discussion with the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide). This non-skill knowledge certainly adds to the colour of the game and will affect skill checks (for example a shepherd may have to roll for a lower target on their [Medicine](skill:medicine) roll to cure a sheep) but there are very few adventures that rely purely on who's the better baker.

> [note]: #
Although the rules of the game don't require players to spend extra time or seek a tutor/source book to improve their skills, of course the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide) can decide to make the game more lifelike by introducing these concepts. When doing so, it's worth however to take into account the category of the skill (combat/movement/knowledge/etc.), difficulty and the existing skill rank of the character.

## Ancestry

The people of Metatholm were originally embodiments of powerful spirits which still echoes today, so every player character has to choose an [ancestral spirit](character:ancestry). The main effect of this choice is on the character's abilities, which can be increased or decreased.

On top of that it of course also affects the looks of the character albeit in a much less prescriptive way than the somewhat similar concept of "race" does in many other games. So you can be a bearded elf or a fairly tall-ish dwarf, although it's always worth picking at least one or two aspects typical to the chosen ancestry (e.g. pointy ear, prominent canines or excessive body hair).

What ancestry has absolutely no effect on is the skills of the character. In the world of Metatholm nobody will automatically be good at archery just because they had elven ancestors. Although it is quite plausible that they will show an otherwise inexplicable interest in these things, they'll have to learn it like everyone else.

## Background

The [background](character:background) of the character shows what prior knowledge they have at the start of the game. (This assumes that the character is on the brink of adulthood, which is almost always the case.)

Each background gives therefore a set of starting skills, and some minor adjustment to abilities on top of that.

Later in the game (apart from possibly a reputation) the chosen background has no further effect on the game, the character can freely improve their skills in any way they like.

## Life Force

One of the things that differentiates a player character (vagabond) from the average guy is their life force and their ability to endure pain. A vagabond is capable and willing to fight with wounds that would have long ago forced an ordinary soldier to rout.

This is represented by two values in the game: maximum [Life Force Points](character:ep) and [Pain Tolerance Points](character:fp). The former shows the amount of serious wounds the character can withstand, the latter is for smaller wounds and fatigue.

This is thus the maximum the character can reach and every wound will reduce their current values. Of course the character can also heal, but only to the indicated maximum

If the character's Pain Tolerance falls to 0, the character will become unable to fight any more. This doesn't necessarily mean a loss of consciousness, it is possible that the character simply falls to their knees, their arm too weak to raise their weapon in defence. If their companions shield them from an immediate death blow, they will later recover fairly easily from this state.

If however the character's Life Force falls to 0, that's serious trouble. Without quick magical intervention (e.g. [Suspended Animation spell](spell:suspended_animation)) the character irrevocably dies.

> [note]: #
As the character levels up, these maximums grow too but not in equal measure: on lower levels life force will be dominant but as the level of danger increases in later game, so does the importance of avoiding serious wounds.

## Character Level

Player characters are considered level 1 at the start but throughout their adventures they will move to higher and higher levels. Compared to many other games this happens relatively more often but the effect can feel smaller too: only the [Lfe Force](character:ep), [Pain Tolerance](character:fp) and [Skill](character:kp) points increase. The latter can immediately be spent on improving existing skills or learning new ones but they can also be squirreled away for use the next time the character levels up.
