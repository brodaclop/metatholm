# Vagabonds

> “They say whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad. But what do the gods do to those they want to recruit?”

**Vagabonds** are strange creatures, they're ordinary people but they're also something else. The spirit living in them has been chosen by a god of another world to one day represent them on their world. First though they want to test their spiritual strength.

**Without any divine help.**

Vagabonds are not part of society. Definitely not polite society, who will at best shun them, but not the fringes of society either, where they may be grudgingly accepted but will always be **the Other**. Even if they're deeply charismatic, people in their presence will feel uneasy, slightly on edge.

Vagabonds may not physically wander around from place to place but they will always be drifting at the whim of powers greater than them who don't care one jot about their fate. Some rebel against this, some resignedly accept this existence and some try to get the best out of it, it makes no difference to the end result.

For there are definite upsides to being almost invisible to the rich and powerful, there is an existence to be eked out here, where official codes of honour and traditions are worth nothing. Sometimes things just need to be done and those who need it doing can't afford to do it themselves. But they can afford to pay someone to do it. Someone nobody will notice moving across the land, someone who is not bound by the complex network of duties and obligations the high societies of **Metatholm** often come with, and someone whose testimony –should they be caught– nobody will believe anyway.

That's when vagabonds come into their element.

**So this is you.**

This is your lot in the world of Metatholm.

The role of the heroic outsider.

But remember: just because you're heroic doesn't mean you're the heroes. You may think you're the good guys and still may not really be. You may even become popular with many and still be a villain.

But remember this also: no matter how powerful you grow, you're still an outsider, living on the fringes. Your actions won't change history. Unless...unless you catch history at one of those rare tipping points where fate is focused into a single point in space and time, and a tiny action can push history down one road or another.

**But you'll never ascend to godhood. You'll never even be a king. You'll never beat a dragon in a fair fight.**

All this of course doesn't mean you'll be forgotten. The **Monks** will keep records of your deeds. Common folk may remember your name for centuries. Your life can become the kernel of truth hiding at the core of an ever-billowing legendarium.

There is a point to this existence but you'll have to figure it out yourself.
