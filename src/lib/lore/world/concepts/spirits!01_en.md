# Spirits

The world of Metatholm is a world of spirits.

Most of them are floating freely across the universe, interacting only briefly with objects and other spirits as they pass them. Such a spirit could be anything, an idea, a feeling, a memory, a concept or a more complex entity looking to inhabit a living body, az object or even a place. 

When they succeed, they will bind themselves to the physical world, becoming a **soul**, a **ghost in the machine** or a **genius loci**. From this point on, they will vehemently protect their host and will do everything in their power to prevent their destruction. Should they fail, they will once again become untethered, drifting the endless seas of the spirit world that is superimposed on the physical one. With time they may even bind themselves once again, even to a different type of host.

There are many stories for example about dead blacksmiths whose tools would later "refuse" to work for some people and cooperating with others, people who feel they were born to live in a faraway place they had never seen or elaborate ancient elven broaches that bring visions and dreams of endless pristine forests to those who wear it.

## Souls

Souls are probably the best-known type of bonded spirit, as they are the spirits inhabiting living beings. Some say every creature has one, down to individual blades of grass, others will insist only the smartest animals and people have them. There are speculations that higher spirits can sometimes inhabit "lower" forms of life, giving rise to tales about speaking animals and walking trees. And nobody knows for sure whether dragons have one, or are they the manifestation of a different kind of spirit altogether.

## Ghosts in the machine

These spirits bind themselves to objects, not necessarily machines in the traditional sense but more often than not objects that took a lot of work to construct. They can influence the users or wearers of their host object, they can provide inspiration, protection but also bad luck and accidents. Not all objects have their own spirits, in fact most of them don't. And even those that do may try to hide their presence from certain other spirits.

## Genii locorum

These spirits often operate in groups, choosing to inhabit various objects or aspects of a place. The place could be as small as a secluded grove or an entire forest, a waterfall or the whole river, a stone circle on a hilltop or a huge mountain range. Even cities can have their own genius loci. They also vary by how strongly they react to visitors, some will rarely show themselves, others will do their best to drive away anyone approaching. They can evoke strong emotions in souls or absorb the emotions already present in them. The latter are highly sought by those who are seeking enlightenment through meditation or just want to silence the voices of guilt inside them.
