# Swampfaeland

## Background

Swampfaeland got its name from apparently being once populated by swamp fairies, and being a member of the old Sylvan Alliance a long-long time ago. Of course no trace of this past is visible in the current country whose cities and towns were founded and populated two hundred years ago by Godoran raiders (who had sailed through the [Dragon Straits](world:realms:dragon_straits:realm) and headed north), and their descendants.

The first travellers found rivers rich in fish and gold, which attracted more and more settlers. As they proceeded upstream on the River Wide and its tributaries, they found mountain slopes rich in tea shrubs, which is what has made this country famous, apart from its gold.

The country also has numerous impenetrable forests where few dare to venture and the few who return have spoken about fae magic and other weird things there.

## Economy

Thanks to its gold the country is a popular destination of traders of luxury goods, with iron being another commodity the country needs to import, especially on the lower stretches of the River Wide. In the inner provinces they use iron sand to make enough iron and steel, mostly for their armies.

Swampfealand tea is sought after all around the world, as are the strange timbers of its forests which are said to be infused with the ancient magics of the fae. Diamonds shine brighter a jewellery box made of this wood, a sword never gets stuck in a fairy wood scabbard, and dozens of similar stories ensure that this exceedingly rare timber fetches a hefty price.

## Governance

The country has no central ruler, its provinces are led by constantly bickering warlords who only come together to fight under one banner when threatened by an external attack. Order is maintained mostly by the retainers and mercenaries of the local warlord, with the local population being powerless to do anything about their frequent abuse of this power. Not least of all because wielding arms is strictly forbidden for them. Whoever is caught with visible weapons without a permit from a local warlord is given fifty-five lashes of the whip on the spot.

## Military

The mercenary armies of the warlords are mostly comprised of lightly armed spearmen who also carry short swords and large, oval shields with rims that bend prominently backwards. The shield is very important especially on marshy terrain where along with the spear they double up as a means of transportation. For the same reason even officers rarely wear armour heavier than gambeson.
