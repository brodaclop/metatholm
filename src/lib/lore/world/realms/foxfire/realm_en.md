# Foxfire

## Background

The frozen south-eastern corner of the continent is deemed by many to be completely uninhabitable. To the west, the barren, icy boulders of **Stonyfield** are said to have fallen from the sky, digging out the thousands of lakes of all sizes, whose shores a few shrubs and grasses barely manage to cling on to in the freezing westerly winds.

But on the eastern edge of this field the **River Kalovin** flows in a valley, and the rivermouth is where you will find the city-state of Foxfire. Although it mostly consists of a few dozen large villages a few hours' walk from each other, the port and the granaries, smithies and salterns that surround it definitely make it what people would call a city.

Here, between the valley and the sea the warmth of the earth feels stronger, so much so that snow only settles in the winter month and the verdant fields are not only enough for cattle to graze on them, even rye can be grown in places. The water of the bay where the river runs never freezes, fishing is possible all year round.

As wispy fog tends to rise from the river, often covering it completely, this area is often called **Mistvale** by the locals.

The inhabitants of Foxfire are almost exlusively of [Kalovin](ancestry:kalovin) ancestry, some even say this is the Kalovin homeland whence they radiated to the rest of the world. But local stories dispute this: Foxfire is merely the first place where the Kalovin settlers of old landed their (seafaring or flying, there's still no agreement on this) ships.

Be that as it may, the Kalovins like to wander and discover, throughout the centuries they traversed and mapped **Stonyfield** for example, although only the foolhardiest of them would volunteer for these expedictions. Not just due to the harsh weather and extremely limited food supply but also because sometimes at night strange stone- and ice creatures are roaming the land.

There are two reliable signs that they're afoot: firstly the disappearance of arctic foxes, usually quite active in the evening, and secondly the blue-green lights dancing in the sky. Thus these lights have been named **foxfire** by the Kalovins, hence the name of the city.

Arctic foxes are hunted for their fur too but every hunt has to be followed by a sacrificial offering to appease the spirits of the land, of which arctic foxes are a manifestation. Clothing made from its pelt is thus highly treasured, also because of its scarcity and its ability to protect from the icy winds better than anything else. These arctic fox breeches, cloaks or hats —often mended thousands of times— are handed down through generations, making travellers to these shores conclude the people of this land took little pride in their appearance when in fact they're often looking at their most prized possession.

## Economy

The other big treasure of the country is made out of the rocks of **Stonyfield**, as many of them are made from a metal lighter and tougher than the strongest steel. This metal, which is easy to forge but hard to work cold, is collected by highly trained hands, only for the smiths of Foxfire to turn it into blades and armour that their merchants take east on the southern seas, or up the river to the north, to sell them at an eye-watering price. The merchants afterwards return with many goods that would be unavailable in the frozen south.

Which stones can be worked this way is a closely guarded secret and while there are always overly confident outworlder adventurers who come to this faraway land to get hold of the secret or just the raw steelstone, none have returned alive.

## Governance

The country is led by the chief saman, inasmuch as their activity can be called leadership. They perform the rituals marking and blessing the passing of the seasons, the setting off and return of explorers and merchants, and as such they enjoy unquestioned respect. It is for this reason that when for example the leaders of a village want a decision in their affairs, they'll seek out the chief saman to make justice. They have no written code of laws but a bewildering network of local customs and unwritten laws, whose breaking they take equally seriously. The only exception is welcome visitor, whose minor transgressions they're willing to overlook.

## Military

Foxfire has no standing army, but only a fool concludes from this that they're easy prey. And not just because anyone trying to take a larger military force here has to overcome the challenge of the long journey there.

While there's nobody in Foxfire's vicinity who they'd need to war with, and the villages usually sort out their differences in the form of a mass brawl, every child learns the basics of using a sword. Even later, in adulthood, they will get out the wooden practice swords or sometimes the bow, provided there's no job to do around the house.

Real experience in fighting to the death however is only possessed by the **Stonyfield** explorers and collectors, and the retainers of the merchants. The tactical and survival skills of the stone collectors is particularly handy in defending against the occasional raid.

When a couple of years ago a group of mercenaries sailed down the River Kalovin to take some Kalovin slaves, they found the first village abandoned, as if everyone had hastily fled to the woods from them. They set off therefore to scour the forest and grab the frightened villagers, which proved to be a fatal mistake. THe villagers ambushed and massacred them in small, mobile groups, a lot of the mercenaries didn't even have time to cry out in pain or to warn the others. By nightfall everyone returned to the village and were cheerfully debating how to split up the clothes, weapons and other items of the attackers, and their slave barges were later turned into barns to store hay for the winter.
