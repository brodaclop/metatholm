# Crow's Domain

## Background

Far in the north-eastern jungles of Metatholm lies the mysterious isolated country that is only mentioned as Crow's Domain. Who exactly Crow is, nobody knows, not even the inhabitants of Crow's Domain. They're a magical being that nobody has seen, but who nevertheless controls the country and is rumoured to be able to even control the vast river it's built around.

As the **River Bentwater** meandered solemnly across the jungle from the west to the east, peoples of old cut a thin strip out of the jungle on the muddy river bank and this is where all the towns and cities are to this day. Of course they aren't the same cities, they were washed away and rebuilt multiple times over the millennia. To say this is like a magnet for hunters of ancient treasures would be an understatement.

## Economy

The rich loam of the riverside makes great soil for growing almost anything. Fishing is usually only a secondary source of food, as the hot and humid climate and the lack of readily available salt on the upper stretches of the river means fish needs to be eaten pretty much on the day it was caught. The jungle provides timber for building and animals to be hunted.

There is virtually no trade in and out of Crow's Domain, apart from the one port city on the Eastern Sea. As iron ore is very scarce, most tools are made of bronze, for which the copper and tin are mined upriver. Only weapons of war are thus made of steel.


## Governance

As mentioned before, the country's sovereign is the entity called Crow and they've been for hundreds of years. Nobody knows if it's still the same entity and nobody dares to ask questions like this. Crow rules the land through their emissaries, a group of small telepathic monkeys who roam the tree canopies, delivering Crow's often cryptic missives to mayors of towns and other local leaders. Nobody finds this strange.

Apart from this, individual towns are largely independent, the bigger ones have written laws and law enforcement, punishments are rumoured to be incredibly harsh, especially for people (be they local or travellers) who try to dig up artefacts of old without Crow's permission and anyone who is caught killing any kind of monkey.

## Military

The military power of Crow's Domain is heavily concentrated on the fortified cities on lower reaches of the river, they garrison a lot of archers, heavy infantry and enslaved shock troops who are promised (and in fairness, usually given) freedom should they survive their suicidal missions.
