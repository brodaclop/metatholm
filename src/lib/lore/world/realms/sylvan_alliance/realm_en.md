# The Sylvan Alliance

The story of **The Sylvan Alliance** is somewhat similar to that of [The Deep Kingdom](world:realms:deep_kingdom:realm): the forests that once reached from coast to coast on the continent were home to a loose alliance of elven kingdoms of various sizes. As the forests thinned out and broke up, so did the alliance, and the folks once inhabiting them similarly dissolved into the roaring crowds of the outside cities, towns and villages, just like the orcs and dwarves of the deep.

But unlike the underground world, forests never left completely uninhabited. Throughout history the survivors of many a defeated nation sought refuge and found a temporary home in the forest.

The restless elves and gnomes (for the ancestors of some indeed came from the tree kingdoms) didn't set out as one large team to rebuild the once mighty **Sylvan Alliance**, they felt themselves more as refugees too, moving to the wilderness alone, in pairs or family.

However they didn't see it as their temporary home, they saw it as an opportunity for a new family, a new life. This is how the first "hamlets" sprung up in the deepest, hardest to reach parts of the remaining forests of the world. These isolated, self-sustaining villages slowly grew and began to thrive, and this would've stayed that way were it not for the arrival of an elf Mage who has only been mentioned as **Hornbeamleaf** ever since.

**Hornbeamleaf** didn't arrive with empty hands, as an erstwhile court Mage, she had acquired quite a tidy fortune and magical library. On her arrival she immediately set about connecting the elven settlements of the biggest forests with teleport gates, and strengthening the defences of these deep forest dwellings with powerful magic. It was her dream to resurrect the **Sylvan Alliance** of old, of which she then became the first Mistress.

**The Sylvan Alliance** is still relying on this network of gates and the magical traditions started by **Hornbeamleaf** for cohesion, and today there's no forest of appreciable size devoid of their presence, although even the ordinary folks living on the verges of these forests are completely oblivious to this.

Not much is known about the inner workings of this realm, if anything they're even more isolated and secretive than [The Deep Kingdom](world:realms:deep_kingdom:realm), relying on secrecy rather than armed battle to defend their borders. Although it's been said that on not one occasion armies camping near a forest, preparing to cut a swatche through it had been overrun at night by marauding orcs seemingly coming out of nowhere, and the bodies of those who fled into the forest from the initial assault were found the next day peppered with elven arrows. If they were found at all.

Some say this is a sign that the two splinter-realms are also connected by a teleport gate but nobody's found proof of this, at least nobody's presented one.
