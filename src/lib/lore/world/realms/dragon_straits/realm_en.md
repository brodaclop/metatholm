# Dragon Straits

## Background

One of the most westerly states of the continent got its name from the sea channel bisecting it in east-west direction. And the dragons, a few of whom are rumoured to still dwell in the parts of southern mountain ranges unreachable by explorers.

The country is relatively tiny, its importance lies in the fact that they control the strait, and thus all the sea trade between the outer ocean and the inner sea. Accordingly they don't produce much, on the other hand their merchants, shipwrights and innkeepers are renowned the world over.

## Economy

Most of the country's income can be tied to trading: high duties, well-guarded warehouses and comfy taverns await those willing to sail across the straits. Its shipwrights are famous far and wide for the speed of their work and the steepness of their prices. And of course the navy offers protective escorts to merchants rightly vary of pirates.

Although slave trade is strictly forbidden in Dragon Straits, this doesn't mean that slave ships can't cross the straits after paying the appropriate duty.

## Governance

The current ruler of Dragon Straits is **Queen Matilda VI (The Slender)**, who ascended to the throne at the age of 37, following the death of her father, **King Alden III**. Since time immemorial, the kings and queens of the land have come from the same extended family, as Dragon Straits has very strict primogeniture. Interestingly, it was the coronation of Queen Matilda that was preceded by a challenge to the status quo. As at the time of the king's passing Princess Matilda was staying in the north, the admiral of the fleet had the idea of sailing up to South Jaw with three galleons and getting himself crowned. As this caught the guard of the royal castle off guard, he quickly occupied the Great Tower and gave out the order for the coronation the morning after. Nobody knows how it happened but in the middle of the night the Great Tower caught fire and burned to the ground. Luckily, **Prince Ortig**, the permanent secretary of the monarch, managed to rescue the coronation jewels but the admiral and the officers of his fleet all perished in the blaze.

Laws are made by the monarch via the help of a five-strong advisory committee, whose members are: the constables of North and South Jaw, the guildmasters of the Merchant's and the Shipwright's Guild and the admiral of the fleet, whose official base is Fort Gullet.

Nobility is fairly limited: leaders of cities may wear the title **Earl**, the admiral of the fleet and the constable of [South Jaw](world:realms:dragon_straits:settlements:south_jaw) are bestowed the non-hereditary title **Margrave** and members of the royal family are **Princes** and **Princesses**. On top of this there are a few hundred **Knights** across the realm who may be entitled to a royal stipend or a small holding (a few hamlets at most) and are required to pay military service to the monarch. Taxes are always paid to the local lord, who acts on behalf of the monarch and transfers the monarch's share of the taxes to the royal treasury. The exception to this rule are the free royal villages, who proudly pay their taxes directly to the king or queen.

## Military

As it's clear from the above, the main military force of Dragon Straits is maritime, although the three walled cities ([North Jaw](world:realms:dragon_straits:settlements:north_jaw), [South Jaw](world:realms:dragon_straits:settlements:south_jaw) and [Fort Gullet](world:realms:dragon_straits:settlements:fort_gullet) have considerable forces garrisonned in their castles. The military are mostly used as a deterrent, successfully, some might say, as it's over two hundred years that the country last faced a serious military threat: a small army landed under cover of night to the south of Oakvale and ransacked the town but the main invasion fleet arriving a week later caught fire and sank at sea near Fort Gullet.
