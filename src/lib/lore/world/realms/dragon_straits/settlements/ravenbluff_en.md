# Ravenbluff

Ravenbluff is a village of approximately fifty houses in the southwestern corner of the country. Its main source of income is the rich and fertile land of the river delta, although of course fishing is an important activity too.

As a free royal village, they pay their tax to the royal treasury mainly in grain and cheese, they also pay a tribute of fish to the monks in the north, dried in the warm oceanic breeze of the summer. Whatever grain they store they take to Hillden for milling but they brew their beer at home.

There is no regular armed presence in the area so robbers are not uncommon in the area.

## Typical adventures

Rural crime.
