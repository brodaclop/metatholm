**Oakvale** was originally built on the right bank of the **River Quietwater**, only a few miles from its estuary that opens into the **Inner Sea**. The riverbed isn't too muddy, at high tide even the biggest galleons can easily sail up it all the way to the port of Oakvale. The majority of its cca. 8000 inhabitants work in the port and the glass blowing and smelting workshops on the left bank. These had been banned from the heart of the town due to causing too many of the neighbouring houses to burn down.

The settlement on the left bank of the river can roughly be divided into two neighbourhoods: **Ironfield** and **Glass Mountain**, this is where most of the "smoky" trades operate, but this is also the place where many generations ago orcish tanners and leatherworkers settled, thanks to which this part of town can boast a sizeable orcish community.

The two banks are connected by wooden bridges, and downriver of the last one begin the disorganised mess of wooden treadmill cranes and piers that is known as **Port Town**. This is where most of the trade happens, it's where wrought iron, steel and copper is hoisted into barges that take the wares for smiths of faraway lands to turn them into weapons, armour and other useful items.

The lord of the town is **Earl Odegra** whose palace can be found in the fashionable **Forest's Edge** district. The toll takers of the port are in his employment, and while there is no city guard as such, the earl's retinue is keeping public order in the whole town, especially during the frequent riots. These riots often start from the **Guild of Smelters**, who are usually burdened with the highest toll when selling their wares.

Public safety in town isn't great, especially after dark; while there is no specific Oakvale thieves' guild, a lot of overseas clans maintain an "embassy" here.
