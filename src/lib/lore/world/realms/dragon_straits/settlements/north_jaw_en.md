# North Jaw

Of the two cities straddling the straits, North Jaw is by far the newer: it was built only about 300 years ago as a protective (or threatening) military and naval outpost for passing ships. Not long after, people moved from the south side, first for the job opportunities serving the needs of the military offered, but in two generations it grew into a city in its own right.
