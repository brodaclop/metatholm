# Fort Gullet

Fort Gullet is the main base of the Dragon Straits navy and was built almost exclusively to serve the fleet. Its vast port is protected by two massive stone breakwaters, on the far end of each a lighthouse that also serves as a bastion.

The majority of the city has been carved into the mountainside that rises behind the port, this is where you'll find the garrison, the granaries, the wood stores and of course the many reservoirs that are fed by deep wells. Outlanders won't gain access to any of that, they're only allowed in the harbour district that is full of inns, taverns, store-houses and of course the shipwrights' buildings and dry docks.

The streets are fairly safe, at least as far as robbery and thievery is concerned, which are very rare around here, as opposed to groups of drunken seamen assaulting random people on the street, some of them fatally.

The Fort Gullet fleet may look unreasonably big at first, until we learn that one of the main sources of the city's income is giving naval escort to merchant fleets. This doesn't come cheap but it's still cheaper than being attacked by pirates.

## Typical adventures

Escorting merchants, spying, piracy.
