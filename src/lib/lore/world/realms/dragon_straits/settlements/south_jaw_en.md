# South Jaw

Many centuries ago it was known as **Cliffburgh**, this city became the first proper city of the nascent realm of Dragon Straits. "South Jaw" was simply a joke name given to it by its people when a sister city was built on the north side of the straits, and it stuck.

South Jaw is the first city not just chronologically, it is also the home of the royal palace and the citadel, not to mention the guildhouses of all the major guilds. Its cca. 30000 inhabitants come from all corners of the world, or are the descendants of those who did. Despite this its citizens are fiercely proud of the city they feel is very much their own.

Although it is a royal capital, governance of the city is officially in the hands of the Constable of the city. The Constable is elected by the citizens themselves although it's vanishingly rare that the winner of the vote isn't the highest ranking officer of the royal palace's garrison.

## Typical adventures

Smuggling, inter-guild tensions, gang wars, court intrigue.
