# Ferrymen

The **Ferrymen** are mostly talked about as a thieves' guild by those who have heard of them. But this is a misnomer as their main profile is smuggling and piracy. In the town of [Westport](world:realms:dragon_straits:settlements:westport) they're unavoidable, hardly any ship leaves the port without their knowledge and consent. Smaller smuggling outfits even pay a "toll" for their free operation and of course a life without stab wounds.

Their pirate ships patrol the Inner Sea shores of [Dragon Straits](world:realms:dragon_straits:realm), preying on the unwary, though they never attack merchant ships escorted by the Navy.

As for their smuggling activities, inbound they chiefly smuggle narcotics and outbound enslaved children whom they catch themselves on the streets of Dragon Straits' cities. Foreign visitors on their return home from [South Jaw](world:realms:dragon_straits:settlements:south_jaw) often remark with admiratoin on how few street urchins there are in the royal city, if only they knew why. The locals often do know but they either feel it relieves their streets of potential criminals, or convince themselves the kids will have a better life as a slave, or indeed are just plain scared to do anything about it.

As they also distribute the imported narcotics in the country themselves, they are present in varying numbers in every port city, maintaining an "embassy" of sorts. These are basically camouflaged "warehouses" where slaves waiting for shipping or drugs waiting for handover to local sellers are stored. These outwardly ordinary-looking safehouses are usually located in the richer parts of town where neighbours don't ask many questions, and in any case, who'd find a rich "merchant" with a dozen or so "servants" suspicious?

The symbol of the clan (often tattooed on members' backs) depicts a skeletal figure standing upright in a flat-bottomed boat, directing his vessel with a punt pole.
