# Tinker

If something needs fixing, you'll look for a **Tinker**. If someone needs fixing, the same. If you don't know how to hide your weapons, if you need to set or find a trap, if you want to wear an armour that doesn't get you arrested at the first guard post, you better be in their good books. Cos if you're in their bad books, you might quickly realise how unhealthy tiny crossbow bolts can be to the body.
