# Sneak

Street urchin, pickpocket or military scout, a **Sneak** can be many things. If you want to follow their footsteps in the street, pray that they haven't spotted you or else you have no chance. But if you do manage to catch and corner them, be prepared to face all the dirty fighting tricks you can imagine, and even some you can't.
