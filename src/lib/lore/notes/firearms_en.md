## On the Absence of Firearms

Many Medieval Europe-inspired RPGs grapple with the question: to firearm or not to firearm.

After all, in historical reality rapiers emerged well after muskets were invented. Sabres were carried on battlefields that also featured machine guns. And cutlasses were often actively paired with pistols.

So if all those swords can exist in a fantasy world, why not the contemporaneous firearms?

**It is definitely not because it's "unrealistic"** (whatever that word even means in a world where dragons and magic are real) because we've seen how they coexisted in our own real reality.

**The other frequent objection is that it'd upset game balance.** And while this may serve as good reason not to introduce them into games that hadn't been designed for them but not why not to include them right from the start. After all, the earliest (personal) firearms were considerably less useful than say the crossbows of the time.

None of these is the reason why firearms don't feature in Metatholm.

The real reason is that **they make for very different stories**. Not bad stories just different ones. So at the end of the day it all came down to a simple narrative choice.

## Should I disregard this and introduce them anyway?

If you think you'd have more fun with the game that way, who am I to stop you? The system should be able to accommodate them. If you're worried about balance, I'd advise you to introduce two actions: a quick one for firing them and a quite slow one for reloading, which was definitely one of the major weaknesses of muzzle-loaded firearms.

But bear in mind also that it'd necessarily come with the appearance of cannons on battlefields and ships, and in general a more mechanistic world, where the rules of physics play a far more important role than Metatholm was originally intended to have.
