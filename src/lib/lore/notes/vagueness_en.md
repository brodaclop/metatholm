# On the vagueness of memory

Many descriptions of historical events on these pages are pretty vague, especially when compared to the "canon" lore of other fantasy worlds.

This was a deliberate choice: in the world of Metatholm (just like in our own real world) history as remembered doesn't always match history as it happened. For example is the origin of the [Kalovin](ancestry:kalovin), as mentioned in the section about [Foxfire](world:realms:foxfire:realm). Who remembers what really happened thousands of years ago? And who can tell the truth from the legend?

**History as remembered is unreliable.**

To cite another example, this time from the real country of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, their House of Lords houses an important historical artefact: the Woolsack. This, as its name suggests, is a sack filled with wool on which the Lord Speaker sits, a kind of medieval beanbag. It's filled with wool to symbolise the erstwhile importance of this material to England and English economy.

This is history as remembered.

History as it really happened however tells us that in 1938 they opened up this ancient sack, only to find that it had in fact been filled with horse hair. So they replaced it with wool to make it fit the story. Were it not for written record of this event, we'd still believe this is how it's always been. **If** we can trust the written record, that is.

All this is not to say that historical truth is not important in Metatholm, and everything is just a matter of opinion.

**But it's up to the Game Master to determine what it is, the lore as written only lists possibilities.**

What this means is that your Metatholm may be very different from my Metatholm and everyone else's Metatholm. And this is fine.
