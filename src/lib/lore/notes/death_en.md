## On the Death of Player Characters

In most TTRPGs sooner or later comes a point when a player character, despite the player's best efforts, passes away.

This is why some systems allow for the resurrection of creatures, but in Metatholm that is impossible.

Once someone dies, their spirit leaves them and that's the end of the story...at least as far as that particular body is concerned.

Because due to the nature of [spirits](world:concepts:spirits), it is perfectly possible for a departing spirit to choose to inhabit another living being straight away.

In practice this means that when a player is forced to re-roll a character, the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide) can allow the spirit of their previous character to be present in it.

This doesn't confer the new character any extra skills or knowledge of their prior life, beyond a vague attraction to their previous companions. In return, these companions, especially ones skilled in [Spirit magic](skill:spirit_focus) can also recognise that the new person showing up in their life is somehow familiar...
