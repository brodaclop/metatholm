# Shields

`SkillTraining`

**Shields** are probably the oldest type of defensive fighting implement. They can be small or big, round, square or elongated, can be held in hand or strapped to the forearm, but what they have in common is that their main purpose is to interpose and block attacks. For a shield to be effective in a fight, it has to be wielded properly, just having it strapped to one's back may offer some protection from projectiles but will be of little use in any other combat situation.
