# Camouflage

`SkillTraining`

The **Camouflage** skill determines how well a character can make themselves, or anyone/anything else look like something else.

The difficulty of a task depends on three factors mainly: the number of creatures/size of the object to be camouflaged, the time available and how "busy" the surrounding environment is. I.e. it's a lot easier to camouflage something in a dense forest than in a featureless grassy plain.
