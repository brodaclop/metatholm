# Axes

`SkillTraining`

The category of **axes** comprises of top-heavy hafted one- or two-handed weapons with a cutting or piercing head on the end. Thus warpicks and warhammers also fall into the same category. Their closest relatives are [maces](skill:maces) but unlike with maces, orientation of an **axe** type weapon matters when striking and they can also be used for hooking. They are also similar to [knives](skill:knives) in that they can sometimes double up as tools, although felling axes are usually much heavier and sturdier than battle axes.
