# Magic Force

`SkillTraining|{"skill":"skill:magic_force"}`

**Magic Force** expresses a character's control over the magical powers that exist in everyone. A low **Magic Force** skill would leave a character magically exhausted after only a handful of simple spells, while a highly skilled magician can unleash spells of unimaginable power without much adverse effect.
