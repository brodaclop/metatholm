# Swords

`SkillTraining|{"skill":"skill:swords"}`

The category of **swords** comprises of straight or curved edged weapons whose primary purpose is to give cuts or thrusts. They are one of the oldest kind of metal weapon, and are often as much a symbol of a warrior's status as they're formidable weapons. They are typically light and nimble for their size, although chunkier chopping swords also exist. They also tend to feature some kind of hand protection, which can range from a simple crossguard to very elaborate basket hilts. **Swords** are distinguished from [knives](skill:knives) mainly by their length, although the boundary between a long dagger and a short sword isn't always clear.
