# Jumping

`SkillTraining`

**Junping** shows a character's ability to...well, jump. Far or high.

It would be impossible to put exact numbers to how difficult a jump is but as a guideline, jumping higher than your own height (and landing on your feet), even on a good day and a run-up is a legendary feat. Factors that affect difficulty are height, jump direction, run-up, encumbrance and terrain.
