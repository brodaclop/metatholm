# Alchemy

`SkillTraining`

Learning the skill of **Alchemy** enables the character to handle and make all kinds of concoctions: poisons, anti-venoms, acids, oils, even magical potions.

Handling is relatively speaking the easiest task, following a recipe is significantly harder, and inventing new formulae are the hardest. Circumstances that also affect difficulty are the dangerousness of the product, the abundance of ingredients, the quality of the lab and the users' familiarity with it and of course time.
