# Endurance

`SkillTraining`

**Endurance** shows a character's ability to not get exhausted by prolonged physical activity.

Fighting, running or carrying a lot of weight for a long time could all trigger skill checks (at the [Spirit Guide's](world:concepts:spirit_guide) discretion), which start off easy and get progressively harder unless the character gets some rest. On each failure the character loses `1d5!` [pain tolerance](character:fp).

Another effect is that for each skill rank the character's maximum [pain tolerance](character:fp) increases by 2 per character level.
