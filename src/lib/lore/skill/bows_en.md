# Bows

`SkillTraining|{"skill":"skill:bows"}`

The category of **bows** comprises of weapons where a string is drawn to build tension in a flexible object, which is used to propel an arrow at the target. Bows come in many shapes and sizes, short or long, made from a single piece of wood or laminated, but they are all drawn and held by muscle power, which limits their power and the time archers can take to aim.
