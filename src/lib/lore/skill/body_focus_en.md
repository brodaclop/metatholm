# Body Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Body focus** is the magical discipline of altering the caster's own body. Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character concentrates for 1 round on an upcoming task requiring a **Movement type** skill check, at the end of which they can roll a **Body Focus** skill check. For every 10 point rolled they can add one extra die (`d10!`) to their subsequent movement skill check roll.

## Passive

The character is master of their own pain, if they suffer damage from falling or a similar effect, they can roll a skill check and subtract as many [Pain Tolerance Points](character:fp) from the damage as the result of the roll. Any [Life Force](character:ep) damage they may also suffer is unaffected.
