`SkillTraining`

The **Etiquette** skill shows how well a character knows the dos and don'ts of not only their own culture but also that of faraway lands. Especially the latter can save you a lot of embarrassment or worse.

Difficulty depends on how different the culture or subculture is from those the character is familiar with and how rare the occasion is. So for example knowing basic table manners in a tavern of a neighbouring country is fairly easy, while knowing all the ins and outs of a traditional high-society elven funeral will be very hard.
