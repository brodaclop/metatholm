# Life Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Life focus** is the magical discipline of manipulating the life force of living beings. Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character must concentrate for 1 round on radiating the essence of life out of themselves. At the end of the round they can roll a skill check and force all the undead who witnessed this ritual to roll their attack and defence rolls with a penalty of what the result of the roll was. They stay under the effect of this ritual until they lose sight of the character, which requires them to avert their gaze for at least 1 round. Only undead capable of higher cognition can do so deliberately.

## Passive

The character's being in tune with the constant ebb and flow of life force enables them to automatically detect undead in their surroundings, even if they're trying to hide, and even if they're behind a wall or in a different room altogether. These creatures will show up as wells of darkness in the all-pervasive fabric of life force. The effective radius of this ability is 3 metres for each skill rank.
