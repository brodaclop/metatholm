# Balance

`SkillTraining`

This skill controls the character's ability to establish and maintain their balance. Commonly practised by sailors, horse archers and martial artists, but its undisputed masters are tightrope walkers.

It also contributes heavily to the character's speed, attacking/defending ability and damage in unarmed combat using [Martial Arts](skill:martial_arts).

Keeping your balance while standing still is probably the easiest task relating to this skill, with movement increasing difficulty considerably, and having a narrow and/or unstable surface beneath one's feet adding even more.
