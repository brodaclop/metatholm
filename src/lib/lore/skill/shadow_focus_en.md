# Shadow Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Shadow focus** is the magical discipline of controlling and harnessing shadows, both physical and metaphysical. Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character concentrates for 1 round, at the end of which they can separate their shadow from themselves, making it move independently from them for as many minutes as their skill level. In order to use this ability they can't be in complete darkness, as they won't have a shadow then. The character can direct the movement of their shadow (its pace is 10 metres/minute) and can see and hear what their shadow "sees" and "hears". Of course a disembodied shadow crawling across the floor can also attract unwanted attention from vigilant observers who can roll a [Spot Hidden](skill:spot_hidden) skill check contested by the character's Shadow focus skill.

## Passive

The character can "see" in the dark in a radius of 3 metres per skill level. This only means they sense empty spaces and the silhouettes and boundaries of objects or creatures around them. This ability works with eyes closed or blindfolded, in this case well-lit areas are perceived as completely opaque "walls".
