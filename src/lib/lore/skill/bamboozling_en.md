# Bamboozling

`SkillTraining`

This skill controls how easily the character can fool others, be it by honeyed words, misdirection, sleight of hand.

Difficulty largely depends on how hard someone wants to fool themselves: comforting lies, a feeling of relief, greed and an already split attention all helping the bamboozler.
