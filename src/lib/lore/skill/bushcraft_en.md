`SkillTraining`

This skill shows how well the character can survive in the wilderness with limited resources. This includes obtaining water, food and shelter and navigating or avoiding natural hazards.

Task difficulties depend heavily on terrain: finding water in a desert is very hard, in a boreal forest it's relatively easy. Skill check targets should depend on the resources available nearby and also on the character's experience in a given biome.
