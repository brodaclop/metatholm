# Spirit Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Spirit focus** is the magical discipline of controlling, summoning or detecting spirits, be they bound into mortal bodies or [floating freely in the world](world:concepts:spirits). Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character concentrates for 1 round on the spirits of a place or an object they touch. After this they can start to communicate with said spirits, asking questions about their past. How much of its past a spirit can remember is determined by the result of a skill check.

| Roll | Length of memory |
| :-    | :- |
| 5 | 1 minute |
| 10 | 1 hour |
| 20 | 1 day |
| 40 | 1 week |
| 80 | 1 year |

It's important to state here that what spirits find important (and thus worthy of remembering) can be very different to the priorities of people. For example if a beggar sleeps under the same bush every night, the [genii locorum](world:concepts:spirits) will be able to give a very detailed description while a king who walked past once will most likely not be remembered at all.

## Passive

As they immerse themselves into the Spirit focus, the character's features and body language will reveal less and less about their feelings and thoughts. If someone tries to roll a contested [Bamboozling](skill:bamboozling) skill check, they have to do it not against the character's Bamboozling skill but their Spirit focus skill. This happens automatically, the character doesn't even have to be aware of being observed. Also, as this ability is automatic and doesn't differentiate between friend or foe, sometimes the friends of the character can indeed start to feel the character doesn't care about their mates.
