# Nature Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Nature focus** is the magical discipline of detecting, controlling and summoning natural forces or creatures of nature. Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character concentrates for 1 round on an animal they are touching, after which they can ask the animal to carry out a task, which the animal will try to perform to the best of their abilities. The maximum duration of the task is determined by the result of a skill check√â

| Roll | Maximum duration |
| :-    | :- |
| 5 | 1 minute |
| 10 | 1 hour |
| 20 | 1 day |
| 40 | 1 week |
| 80 | 1 year |

The task has to be one that the animal is capable of by itself both physically and mentally. For example asking a horse to count the number of people who enter their stall a day is a futile attempt, not least of all because even if they could count it, they couldn't tell the result. The task doesn't have to be performed instantly, it could be for example at a hand signal or a whistle. So for example we can ask a dog to guard a chest and growl at anyone approaching it. However the "waiting time" also counts as part of the duration of the task.

## Passive

The character can detect edible plants and sources of potable water (springs, wells, streams, lakes, aquifers) in a radius of 10 metres per skill level.
