# Enchantment

`SkillTraining`

They say a skilled practitioner of **Enchantment** is worth their weight in gold. No wonder: turning mundane, everyday items into magical artefacts is something most people can only dream of. Even if the powers of the items imbued with magic don't necessarily last forever...

To imbue an object with magic one needs three things: [Magic Power](character:mp), time, and of course luck.

First of all the character must choose from the table below the magical effects they want to create and add up the corresponding skill check target modifiers in the second column.

| Weapon Enchantments | |
| :------| ------: |
| **Effect** | **Target modifier** |
| +1 for all stats† | +5 |
| +2 for all stats† | +10 |
| +3 for all stats† | +20 |
| +4 for all stats† | +40 |
| +5 for all stats† | +60 |
| +6 for all stats† | +80 |
| +1 for one stat† | +3 |
| +2 for one stat† | +5 |
| +3 for one stat† | +10 |
| +4 for one stat† | +20 |
| +5 for one stat† | +30 |
| +6 for one stat† | +40 |
| *† Except reach* | |
| **Armour Enchantments** | |
| **Effect** | **Target modifier** |
| For each point of **Damage Reduction** increase | +20 |
| For each point of **Hindrance** decrease | +10 |
| **Stored spells** | |
| For each level of the spell | +10 |
| For each point of strength (at least 1) | +10 |
| If the spell is released by destroying the object (e.g. by drinking a potion or breaking a stick) | +0 |
| If the spell is released on command | +10 |
| If the spell is automatically released when a condition is satisfied (e.g. a magical trap that is triggered by touch) | +20 |
| **Time spent on enchantment** |
| **Time** | **Target modifier** |
| 1 day | -5 |
| 1 hour | 0 |
| 1 round | +10 |
| **Quality of enchanted item** | |
| **Quality** | **Target modifier** |
| Ordinary | 0 |
| Rare or excellently crafted | -5 |
| Gemstone/contains a gemstone | -10 |

Once this is done, the character must sacrifice some of their MPs (or in a dire situation, [Life Force](character:ep)). For each point sacrificed the enchantment holds for a day. If the effect to be enchanted is relatively unchallenging, the character can choose to "squeeze" some more duration out of it, but this increases the target score by 10 for each extra day. In fact if the character sacrifices 10 MPs or more, they can even attempt the impossible: making the effect permanent. This however is a truly exceptional feat as it adds +80 to the skill check target.

After this the character can choose to sacrifice further Magic Power or Life Force to make the skill check easier, with each point adding an extra `1d10!` to their skill check roll.

Finally the character must make a single skill check to determine if the object is successfully enchanted. Should the check fail, the sacrificed Magic Power (and Life Force) is lost. It's important to note that life force lost this way can't be healed magically, only resting and the [Medicine](skill:medicine) skill helps.

## Targeting

When storing a spell in an object, one question arises immediately: who or what is the target of the spell? There is no fixed rule for this but the mode of targeting should depend on the nature of the object being enchanted, a potion will logically target the person drinking it, a wand can be targeted by pointing, etc.

The only real rule is that the mode of targeting needs to be determined by the enchanter, using the guidelines above and in agreement with the [Spirit Guide](world:concepts:spirit_guide).
