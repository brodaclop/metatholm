# Climbing

`SkillTraining`

Climbing trees, rocks and walls.

The easiest things to climb are things that are meant to be climbed, ladders and ropes for example (and they only need a skill check if external circumstances make it difficult, like climbing in a hurry or holding a weapon in one hand), trees and gently sloping rock faces are somewhat harder, the hardest are smooth surfaces and overhangs.
