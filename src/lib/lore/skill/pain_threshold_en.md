# Pain Threshold

`SkillTraining`

The **Pain Threshold** skill determines how strongly a character is affected by painful experiences like being hit with a weapon. A high pain threshold won't save you from major injuries but will make you shrug off small cuts and bruises more easily.

It is very rare that a character would need to explicitly roll a skill check for this skill, unless they're in some kind of contest or it's important 

Another effect is that for each skill level the character's maximum [pain tolerance](character:fp) increases by 2 per character level.
