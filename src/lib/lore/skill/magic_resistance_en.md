# Magic Resistance

`SkillTraining`

**Magic Resistance** is a curious skill, called more of an instinct by many, which is usually practised by those with a low [Magic](ability:magic) ability. Nevertheless this skill, especially its control requires dedicated training and development.

Its primary effect is that the strength of spells or magical effects targeting the character are reduced by a value equal to the character's skill rank in Magic Resistance. This happens automatically so long as the character is conscrious, but the character can decide to drop their resistance against an incoming spell. (Of course they have no way of knowing in advance, what the spell's effect is going to be...)

However should a spell or magical effect be successfully cast on the character, its [detection](skill:magic_force) will be just as much harder for an outside observer. This is also true of the magical items in the possession of the character and naturally this defence can also be temporarily "switched off".
