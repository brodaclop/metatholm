# Personal Charm

`SkillTraining`

The **Personal Charm** skill determines how agreeable others perceive a character. Characters with a particularly high **Personal Charm** score can convince people to fight for a cause or even part with their money.

Difficulty heavily depends on the target's predisposition towards the character and how much the character is asking of them. If you only want them to have a generally favourable opinion of you, that's easy, but if you're after their money, the skill roll becomes lot harder.
