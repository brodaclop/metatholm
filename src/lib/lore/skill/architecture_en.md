# Architecture

`SkillTraining`

While it is unlikely that a character will be asked to design a fortress or a cathedral, but a knowledge of **Architecture** may come handy when coming across ancient ruins or trying to figure out if there's a hidden door in a room.

Amongst the easier tasks are the recognition of the main stylistic elements of a building, approximating the age and the culture that has built it is somewhat more difficult, finding hidden doors and fake walls is even harder and the hardest task (apart from actually designing a building) is finding the load-bearing and weak points of a construction.
