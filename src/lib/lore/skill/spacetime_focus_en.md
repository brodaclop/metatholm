# Spacetime Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Spacetime focus** is the magical discipline of altering and distorting space or time, and how it affects other magic. Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character concentrates for 1 round on the near future, or to be precise on a task that may be performed in it. The task has to be one that requires an uncontested skill check. They can then roll a **Spacetime focus** skill check and if they surpass the target number of the task ahead, they will learn the exact target number. If they fail, all they learn is that the target number is greater than or equal to their roll.

## Passive

As the character's location in space and time has become slightly uncertain, should they be the target of a surprise attack, they get +10 points on their defensive roll for every level they have in this skill. This also applies to situations where they are aware of the incoming threat but for some reason are unable to defend against it, for example because it is coming from behind.
