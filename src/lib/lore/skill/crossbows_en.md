# Crossbows

`SkillTraining|{"skill":"skill:crossbows"}`

The category of **crossbows** comprises of all bow-like weapons that have a lock mechanism to maintain the draw instead of relying on the archer's physical strength to do so. They can vary in size from tiny handheld "toys" to massive, crew-operated war weapons. They're typically much easier to use than a bow of comparable strength, but they have a lower firing rate and are quite a bit more expensive.
