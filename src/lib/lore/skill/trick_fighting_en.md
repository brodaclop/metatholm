# Trick Fighting

`SkillTraining`

**Trick Fighting** enables the character to attempt combat manoeuvres that don't necessarily aim for doing damage but to gain a positional advantage or quickly dispatch an unprepared opponent.

To use this skill, the character first has to successfully attack an opponent with the chosen manoeuvre, and if the attack roll is successful, they can roll a [contested skill check](rule:skill_check) with this skill against one of their opponent's skills. What is an appropriate skill to oppose a move depends on the move itself. Here are a few examples:

| Move | Opposing Skill | Effect on success |
| ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| [Knockout](action:knockout) | [Endurance](skill:endurance) | The opponent loses consciousness |
| [Trip/Topple Over](action:trip) | [Balance](skill:balance) | The opponent falls to the ground, and is unable to use their [Keep Away](action:keep-away) action |
| [Attack With Hidden Weapon](action:hidden-weapon) | [Spot Hidden](skill:spot_hidden) | The opponent is struck by the hidden weapon, doing damage |
| [Spin Behind](action:spin-behind) | [Reactions](skill:reactions) | The opponent is unable to defend your next attack |
