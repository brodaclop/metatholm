# Elemental Focus

`SkillTraining`

**Elemental focus** is the magical discipline of controlling, summoning and shaping the elements and raw magical energy. Those skilled in it not only gain access to its spells, they also acquire an active and a passive magical ability.

## Active

The character concentrates for 1 round, at the end of which all magical energy stored in their body erupts with deadly force in a sphere with a radius of 3 meters per every skill rank. The blast damages surrounding buildings and objects, and whoever is caught in it must roll a [Reactions](skill:reactions) skill check, contested by the character's Elemental focus skill.

If they fail this check, the damage they suffer is dependent on the number of [Magic Points](character:mp) concentrated into the blast.

| MP | Damage |
| :- | :- |
| 1  | `1d5!` |
| 2  | `3d5!` |
| 3  | `6d5!` |
| 4  | `10d5!` |
| 5  | `15d5!` |
| 6  | `21d5!` |
| 7  | `28d5!` |
| 8  | `36d5!` |
| 9  | `45d5!` |
| 10  | `55d5!` |

## Passive

The character is unusually resistant to elemental forces, every damage caused by them can be reduced by as many [Pain Tolerance Points](character:fp) as the character's skill rank. This has no effect on [Life Force](character:ep) damage suffered, they're just good at handling the pain. The effect also works against damage done by steel or stone weapons but not unarmed combat, wooden or bone weapons.
